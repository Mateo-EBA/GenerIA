# GenerIA - Python IA Development Utilities
## Overview
GenerIA is a repository that provides a collection of utilities and tools to assist in the development of Python-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, with a particular focus on computer vision tasks.

This isn't a fully extensive compendium of utilities, it is a compilation of functions and classes I've developed on different AI projects.

## Features
The repository includes utilities for handling:
- Image filters and preprocessing.
- Data plotting.
- File and directory management.
- Printing process.
- Object detection bboxes.
- [Weights&Biases](https://wandb.ai).

Contributions to the GenerIA project are welcome! If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or new features you'd like to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mateo-EBA/GenerIA).
